MineGame
========

Background
----------

The MineGame is basically an old idea of mine. I've always wanted to create a fully functional business game, and the MineGame is kind of the start of this, where the focus is on the mining operation.

The long term goal is to build up a fully featured business game, where you as a player can choose to go into the mining, water supply, power supply, parts supply, food, transportation industry and so on.

There is no purpose of the game other than building your own business empire. The long term goal is to make it a MMORPG where players can supply each other with goods, services and what not.

Cities grow according to the services offered to it, e.g. the amount of food available, the amount of jobs... Basically I picture the cities as the main consumers of industry end products, i.e. food, cars, electrical devices, power, water and so on.

I've always pictured the game as a first person game where you can walk around and interact with stuff. But maybe that will change over time, who knows.

Why C++?
--------

I started writing it in C++ due to that I had to learn C++ somehow, and why not dust off the old business game idea? And it also seems kind of efficient for this purpose.

Game engine
-----------

I have no idea where to begin with a game engine... hence I have not looked into that yet. Currently I'm focusing on the basic stuff.

The thought process behind what has been done so far
----------------------------------------------------

Currently it's quite detailed what has been done, but that is also kind of the philosophy. For instance take a look at a petrol powered electrical generator this consists of several things:
* Electrical Generator
* Petrol Engine
* Petrol Tank or Fuel Supply

Hence I've started building something that supports this, i.e. EngineSystems, ElectricalSystems, LiquidSystems.

Where will this project go?
---------------------------

No idea... will I continue to work on it? For sure. Will it ever be done? Probably not...
